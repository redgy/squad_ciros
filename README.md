# squad_ciros

This Visual Basic Project utilizes concepts from CS540 Software Internationalization to generate an interactive menu for the Ciro's restaurant in downtown San Diego. The interactive menu is designed for ease of access to tourists wishing to read the menu in their selected language. This menu supports the following languages: English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Mandarin. 

Design Decisions: 
The menu uses a top navigation bar to easily navigate between the categories on the menu and the different languages that are available. The language choices are placed in the top right of the display for easy access. 

The menu inteface supports the right to left reading orientation of the Arabic language. 

Resx files are used for the fluid translation of the menu items from one language to another.
